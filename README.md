This type of method will enable the proponents to test the system for errors and address problems on a daily basis. That is why this is the most suitable method to use since changes are inevitable. The system may experience problems or things that need to be changed. Through using this methodology, changes can be done even in the middle of the process until the project functions well.</p>
